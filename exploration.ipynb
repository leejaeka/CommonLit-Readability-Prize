      "On the basis of the preceding comparisons some writers attempt to trace tentatively the history of the flood tradition current among the peoples of southwestern Asia. A fragment of the Babylonian flood story, coming from at least as early as 2000 B.C., has recently been discovered. The probability is that the tradition goes back to the earliest beginnings of Babylonian history. The setting of the Biblical accounts of the flood is also the Tigris-Euphrates valley rather than Palestine. The description of the construction of the ark in Genesis 6:14-16 is not only closely parallel to that found in the Babylonian account, but the method—the smearing of the ark within and without with bitumen—is peculiar to the Tigris-Euphrates valley. Many scholars believe, therefore, that Babylonia was the original home of the Biblical flood story.\n",
      "Its exact origin, however, is not so certain. Many of its details were doubtless suggested by the annual floods and fogs which inundate that famous valley and recall the primeval chaos so vividly pictured in the corresponding Babylonian story of the creation. It may have been based on the remembrances of a great local inundation, possibly due to the subsidence of great areas of land.\n",

      "And when the mountain top gleamed like a golden spear, they fixed their eyes on the line between the shadow and the sunshine.\n",
      "\"Now,\" said Connla, \"the time has come.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, look! look!\" said Nora, and as she spoke, just above the line of shadow a door opened out, and through its portals came a little piper dressed in green and gold. He stepped down, followed by another and another, until they were nine in all, and then the door slung back again.\n",

The picture was of a blue river and a brown mill, with green willow-trees over it, and a man with sacks on his horse's back stood in front of the mill. This picture was repeated a great many times, all over the paper; and in the corner, where it hadn't come out even, they had had to cut it right down the middle of the horse. It was very curious-looking. She stared at it a long time, waiting for somebody to tell her when to get up. At home Aunt Frances always told her, and helped her get dressed. But here nobody came.

He searched on every hill, in every valley, by every stream, and under all the trees. At last he found a place which was just right. It was not too high nor too low, not too near a stream and not too far away from one, not under too thick trees and yet not away from the trees out in the hot sun. The tiger said to himself, \"I am going to build my house here. The place is all ready for me for there isn't very much underbrush here.\" He began at once and finished clearing the place.

They sprang up and ran out of the woods, and just before they came to the bottom of the hill, they saw right in front of them a beautiful little lake. They were not frightened any more, for there in the water was something radiant and shining. \"It is our own star,\" said they, \"and it has come down to us.\" They never thought of looking up into the sky over their heads. It was enough for them that the star was in the water and so near them. But was it calling them?

Then she wiped her eyes with her hands, for princesses don't always have their handkerchiefs in their pockets, any more than some other little girls I know of.

Frightened as she was, however, she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair could lead. It was very narrow, and so steep that she went on like a four-legged creature on her hands and feet.\n",

On seeing Rustem the rhinoceros retreated, and the elephant was led back. But now the horses were gone. \"Strange things happen to travellers in the forest!\" exclaimed Rustem.\n",

An old soothsayer met her, and she told how it had befallen her married mate. Then he told her the thing to do to save her mate, and that she did. She took her harp to the sea-shore, and sat and played; and the sea-maiden came up to listen, for sea-maidens are fonder of music than all other creatures. But when the wife saw the sea-maiden she stopped. The sea-maiden said, \"Play on!\" but the princess said, \"No, not till I see my man again.\" So the sea-maiden put up his head out of the loch. Then the princess played again, and stopped till the sea-maiden put him up to the waist. Then the princess played and stopped again, and this time the sea-maiden put him all out of the loch, and he called on the falcon and became one, and flew on shore. But the sea-maiden took the princess, his wife.\n",

Then they pulled out some boiled rice from their luncheon box and offered it to the cub, but it showed no sign of wanting to eat; so they stroked it gently on the back, and petted it; and as the pain of the wound seemed to have subsided, they were admiring the properties of the herb, when, opposite to them, they saw the old foxes sitting watching them by the side of some stacks of rice straw. \"Look there! the old foxes have come back, out of fear for their cub's safety.

This industrial fixation is called the Haber-Bosch process. Almost all the nitrogen in industrial fertilizers is fixed through the Haber-Bosch process.\n",
      "This industrial fixation of nitrogen is performed in chemical laboratories and large factories all over the world.

This is the pressure you would feel if you dove 2,000 meters (~6,500 feet) underneath the sea, which is a longer distance than 6 Eiffel Towers stacked on top of one another! This pressurized gas mixture is then heated to very high temperatures (450°C/842°F). Sustaining these high pressures and temperatures requires a huge amount of energy.

We studied these coralloid roots and found a high diversity of bacterial species living inside of them, more than anyone had ever imagined.

      "To understand how each sensory input contributes to the experience of self-motion, it is helpful to remove individual sensory inputs to see what happens. For example, how does removing vision, using a blindfold for example, affect our ability to judge the distance we have traveled, our movement speed, or our movement direction? It turns out that we can actually still perform pretty well when one sense is missing! But if we want to know how each sensory input contributes when all inputs are available, as is the case during most everyday interactions, it becomes difficult to manipulate each input independently. Modern virtual reality (VR) technologies have made this challenge easier (to the experience of self-motion).\n",
      "Using VR, the authors studied the contributions of visual and vestibular information for judging heading direction, which means knowing which way you are going. Participants were seated on a moving platform that moved them forward to the left or forward to the right, at very precise angles. Participants also watched a projection screen that made it look like they were in space, flying through a cloud of stars. The task for participants was simply to judge whether they moved to the left or to the right.\n",

Some TBIs are severe and some are milder. All TBIs can have serious effects, which include bleeding, brain swelling, or tearing of the brain's connections. It is important for researchers to study TBI, so that they can find ways to help those with a brain injury to get better. With this common goal in mind, scientists around the world are researching TBI. People with TBI often come to hospitals or clinics and some become part of research studies. TBI researchers follow athletes and military service members, too, because their activities increase the risk of TBI. In this paper, we review different types of TBI studies.

It is now more important than ever that we understand which species are present in different places and the roles they play in their ecosystems. With this knowledge, we can figure out how to protect important organisms and their habitats. Exciting new technology has made it possible to identify species using DNA that they have released into the environment—this is known as environmental DNA (eDNA). Scientists are now using eDNA to identify species in all kinds of ecosystems across the world.

      "There is, however, a big problem these herbivorous fishes face when they eat algae. It is not easy to digest! Algae, like all living things, are made up of cells, with each specialized for a certain role. The cells of algae hold complex, large chains of sugars, called polysaccharides (pronounced, \"pol-ee-sack-ah-ride\"). Different algae have their own, unique composition of these large sugar chains within their cells. To get energy from algae, herbivorous fishes need to break down these large chains. Inside the guts of fish are molecules known as enzymes (think of them as molecular or chemical scissors) that can break these sugar chains into smaller parts fish can absorb into their bodies. There are many different types of these enzymes, functioning like different workers on a construction team. Each enzyme has a specific job in breaking down different parts of algae. However, not all fish have the right kinds of enzymes to break down algae. So, how are they able to get nutrients from algae that are hard to digest?\n",

But now, thanks to people like Copernicus and Galileo Galilei, we know that the Sun is the center of the Solar System, and the earth orbits around it.

Some research shows that attention differs from person to person and changes depending on what people are paying attention to. For example, while some individuals pay more attention to social information (this is called social attention), not everyone has the same bias for social attention, which makes researchers interested in the root of these differences.\n",

Our bodies can sometimes even detect very small differences between types of sugars and respond differently to each. Artificial sweeteners are highly concentrated—meaning that for the same physical amount, they can be between 200 to 13,000 times sweeter than sugar! Even though artificial sugars are sweeter than real ones, they are nearly calorie-free. In some studies, scientists have even found that people prefer the taste of artificial sugars over real ones. However, there is also data to suggest that there is greater brain activation in response to real sugar than to saccharin (a common artificial sugar), and this effect is particularly strong when people are hungry .\n",

      "Our daily internal clocks are controlled by genes, which are small units of DNA passed down from our parents. These genes contain the code to produce proteins—molecules in the body that carry out specific jobs. Some of the genes that control our internal clocks produce proteins called \"activators\" and others produce proteins called \"suppressors.\" Activators are proteins that turn a gene on, whereas suppressors are proteins that turn a gene off. In our daily internal clocks, we need two activators to bind together to turn on a gene. This gene is usually turned on in the morning. Once this gene is turned on, lots of different proteins are made, including the two suppressors. When there are lots of these suppressor proteins being made, we typically feel energetic and lively! Throughout the day, the concentration of these suppressor proteins increases in our bodies. By the evening, enough suppressor proteins are made to block the activators and turn off the gene.

For example, predation is a type of species interaction in which one organism (a predator) eats another organism (the prey)—this is good for the predator but very bad for the prey! Different ant species can eat many different things, and some ants are important predators. Predatory ants often eat other insects like termites and caterpillars, while other ants eat only plants or fungus. Megaponera ants have only one food—termites—and these ants organize huge hunts in which worker ants infiltrate termite colonies, capture as many termites as they can carry, and bring the termites back to the ant nest to feed to their larvae. But even though many ants are predators, they can also be prey for other animals. Lots of animals like to eat ants: birds, ant eaters, even humans in some parts of the world!

No one knew what happened to it. Many years passed. The soccer gem would only be found when the greatest soccer star was born. Not long ago, there was a boy named David. He was from a poor family. Before David's father died, he gave the soccer gem to his son. At first, the boy didn't know the power of the jewel. He was a teenager when he first used the gem to play soccer. David hadn't gone to school. But with the gem's power, he won every single match he played with his friends. He realized that he could make money for his family from playing soccer. He would open a shop for his mother and send his brother and sisters to school. David became the best professional soccer player that anyone had seen. It was even said that he was from another world!

      "As fruit-bearing plants grow, the fruits accumulate water and nutrients from the plant, and they use these nutrients to create their flesh and seeds. Most growing fruits initially provide protection to the developing seeds. At this stage, fruits are generally hard and unattractive to predators—including us! After seed development and fruit growth, the properties of the fruit change to make the fruit more attractive to potential consumers, such as animals, birds, and humans. These changes include the most common ways by which we judge whether a fruit is ripe or not, including external features, such as softness to the touch, and internal features, such as sweetness. Fruits also change color as they ripen. This happens because of the breakdown of a green pigment called chlorophyll, along with the creation and accumulation of other pigments responsible for red, purple, or blue hues (anthocyanin), or bright red, yellow, and orange hues (carotenoids), to name a few.\n",

      "Every living thing needs food, also known as nutrients. In nature, living things are connected through food webs. Food webs show us how animals and plants are related through feeding relationships, like birds eating fish. But how do nutrients get returned back into the food web? The answer is bacteria! Bacteria are impossible to see with the naked eye. But they are found almost everywhere in the world and are very important for recycling nutrients within habitats, like a river. Scientists use the DNA of bacteria to figure out which bacterial species are present and how these different bacterial species recycle nutrients in a river. Knowing which species are present helps scientists to use bacteria to monitor changes in river habitats. These changes might include the amount of food that is available for larger animals. Bacteria are considered to be the base, or foundation, of the food web, and paying attention to early changes in bacteria may allow us to prevent more extreme changes from causing problems later on for larger creatures.\n",

Now, we will tell you about the different hazards associated with volcanic eruptions.\n",
      "When a volcano erupts explosively, the magma cools and is turned into volcanic ash and gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The ash travels so fast that it is injected far into the atmosphere, as high as planes can travel. Volcanic ash can stop planes from flying, because ash is bad for their engines. Volcanic ash and gas from large eruptions can travel in the atmosphere all around the Earth, changing the climate. Volcanic gases form aerosols (mixture of fine particles) in the atmosphere that reflect the solar radiation back to space and lead to global cooling. In fact, one eruption in Indonesia in 1815 caused a year without a summer in Europe and North America in 1816.\n",

      "You guessed it–science! Fluorescent colors are very special. You might have seen fluorescence\n",
      "before if you have ever seen a blacklight poster or paint illuminated with blacklight. Fluorescent colors seem to glow, because they absorb one color of light and then they emit a different color. This is because of the way the pigment (color) molecules release energy from the light they absorb. When a pigment molecule absorbs light energy, it usually slowly releases the energy as heat. Instead, a fluorescent molecule releases some of the energy from the light it absorbed as new light that has lower energy than the light that was absorbed. Normal pigments just cannot do this—they can only bounce back colors of light that exist already in their environment. That is why fluorescent colors look amazing and a bit unbelievable.\n",
      " Remember how everything looks blue when you are 60 feet under the sea? Like living blacklight posters, fluorescent fish absorb that blue light, and then they emit red light. Fish that live in deeper, bluer water have even brighter red fluorescence.\n",

Bony fish have three pairs of otoliths—the sagittae, the lapilli, and the asteriscii. Otoliths are made of calcium carbonate, the same chemical compound that chalk and limestone are made of. Different fish have otoliths that are different in shape and size, so scientists can find the otoliths in the poop of birds and seals to see what kind of fish these animals are eating-yuck! Otoliths allow the fish to keep their balance and to detect sound and water depth. Otoliths grow continuously during a fish's life, a few microns each day from birth until death. One micron is 1,000 times smaller than one millimeter, so otoliths are typically about the size of a grain of sand in juvenile fish and the size of a fingernail in most adult fish.\n",

      "To interpret context in social settings, your brain relies on a network of brain regions, including the frontal, temporal, and insular regions. These regions help you update contextual information when you focus on something (say, the traffic light as you are walking down the street). That information helps you anticipate what might happen next, based on your previous experiences. If there is a change in what you are seeing (as you keep walking down the street, a mean-looking Doberman appears), the frontal regions will activate and update predictions (\"this may be dangerous!\"). These predictions will be influenced by the context (\"oh, the dog is on a leash\") and your previous experience (\"yeah, but once I was attacked by a dog and it was very bad!\"). If a person's frontal regions are damaged, he or she will find it difficult to recognize the influence of context. Thus, the Doberman may not be perceived as a threat, even if this person has been attacked by other dogs before! The main role of the frontal regions is to predict the meaning of actions by analyzing the contextual events that surround the actions.\n",

Mainly, individuals with this disease will show excessive movement, movement that is generally unwanted and unnecessary.

      "Just about everything we do in life is a game in the game-theory sense. At home, at school, everywhere we go, and just about everything we do, we are playing games. Do not believe me? Think back to the very beginning of your day, when you woke up. How quickly you got out of bed impacted your parents—and how early they woke you up impacted you—so that was a game! Think about what happened next, throughout the rest of the day. From the bathroom to the breakfast table, in the classroom and on the playground, you make choices that impact others as well as yourself. You're playing games! Knowing about game theory can help you improve your experience in those situations—not just to \"win,\" but to improve your relationships and have a happier life.\n",

      "Antibiotics have been used for almost a century to treat bacterial diseases in humans and also in animals. Throughout this time, bacteria have been looking for strategies to survive antibiotic treatment. Imagine a battlefield, where a population of bacteria is attacked by small bullets (antibiotics). If one of the bacteria can find a shield to protect itself, it will survive. The surviving bacteria will have the advantage of being resistant to antibiotics forever and so will their descendants. This is the reason why, when you get sick, you have to take all the pills prescribed by the doctor, even if you already feel better. This is very important to prevent \"survivors\" in the battle! Bacteria resistant to antibiotics (called \"superbugs\") are very dangerous for us, because we have no weapons to fight against them. Also, these resistant bacteria can be transmitted to other people or even to animals. Nowadays, there are a high number of bacteria that have become resistant to many different antibiotics, and this is a threat for people worldwide.\n",

      "Why do humans feel the need to be creative and enjoy creative material? While creativity is a basic part of human thinking, what counts as creativity and how do we measure it? Creativity is often viewed as a subjective field, meaning that everyone's personal opinion about creativity is different, so we need to have a really clear definition in order to understand what creativity is. So, what exactly is creativity? While there are many components of creativity, including originality, pleasure, value, process, and imagination, the definition that scientists use to study creativity puts those components together to say that creativity is an ability to produce something that is both novel (or original) and has utility (is valuable to someone). This definition allows scientists to develop of testable hypotheses about how creativity arises from the human brain.\n",

That is because the human body is made up of all different types of cells – skin cells (which are really flat), heart cells (which beat – for real!), and brain cells (which transmit information), to name a few. Cells have an important feature that prevents us from collapsing into puddles on the ground: they have an outer membrane, made up of special fat molecules, that keeps the water inside from leaking out! Inside the cells, there are more fatty membrane compartments called \"organelles\" that all have their own important jobs. One of the most important organelles is the nucleus. This is where the genetic information in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is found. The nucleus controls which different proteins are expressed in each different type of cell.

      "To understand the mechanism behind reading emotions, let us think about the human face. Have you ever heard the saying \"The eyes are the windows to the soul\"? Maybe it is a bit unlikely to see someone's soul through their eyes (our eyes are not real windows after all), but one of the reasons why people use this saying is because the eyes are very important for understanding what other people are feeling. In fact, we can learn a lot about others from their facial expressions, and other people can tell a lot about us from our faces. Think about all the ways you can express emotions using just your face! Even babies seem to be born understanding the importance of faces, because as early as 9 minutes after birth, babies prefer to look at faces rather than any other objects. By the time they are 12 days old, babies can already imitate the facial gestures of adults. This ability is very important for their development because it helps them to later learn how to speak and to think.\n",

      "Memory is a very large topic, and researchers divide the topic of memory to make it easier to study. There is long-term memory, short-term memory, and working memory. Long-term memory allows you to remember information for some time—for a few minutes, or for your whole life. For example, if you are divided into groups and are given a number, you will remember your group number for the entire activity. Or, you will remember your name for a lifetime. Short-term memory stores immediate information and is erased in less than a minute. For example, if someone tells you a phone number and you dial it immediately and then forget it. It is more difficult to dial a phone number if a person tells you the whole phone number at once, as opposed to telling you the number in bits and pieces. When you work with short-term memory, it is called working memory. For example, when you read a sentence, you need to remember the first words in the sentence until you finish reading the end of the sentence. Or else, the sentence will not make any sense!\n",

These findings help show that the LTP is a critical region for naming proper nouns of various types, including famous faces, landmarks, and now, songs. Without this brain region, people are impaired at naming unique items. This shows us that the LTP is an important brain region for naming proper items. The LTP is called a \"convergence zone\" for naming items. What this means is that the LTP does not store the names of the items, but it is a region where the names of items are related to the information about the items. This explains why people with LTP damage are able to say information about the item but not the name. So, next time you hear a song on the radio and think of its name, remember that you are using your LTP!\n",

      "Well, fireflies or ‘lightning bugs' as they are sometimes called do the same, except that they have an unlimited supply of light within themselves! That is why fireflies never worry about fused light bulbs or electricity tariffs. They seem immensely happy just flying around and glowing- this is their signal to say, \"Hey, look! I'm here!\"\n",
      "The glow of the firefly is produced by a protein called luciferase and a pigment called luciferin. Proteins are special food used by our bodies to create muscles, bones and skin while pigments are natural coloring substances found in plants and animals. When these two meet inside the tiny belly of the firefly, they react with the oxygen already found in there.\n",
      "A celebration takes place, a soft firework display, so to say and bright light is produced which is the ‘glow' of the firefly! Fireflies therefore are bioluminescent but they are not the only ones. Different types of fish and marine creatures in the sea also produce their own lights!\n",

      "The commutator is peculiar, consisting of only three segments of a copper ring, while in the simplest of other continuous current generators several times that number exist, and frequently 120! segments are to be found. These three segments are made so as to be removable in a moment for cleaning or replacement. They are mounted upon a metal support, and are surrounded on all sides by a free air space, and cannot, therefore, lose their insulated condition. This feature of air insulation is peculiar to this system, and is very important as a factor in the durability of the commutator. Besides this, the commutator is sustained by supports carried in flanges upon the shaft, which flanges, as an additional safeguard, are coated all over with hard rubber, one of the finest known insulators. It may be stated, without fear of contradiction, that no other commutator made is so thoroughly insulated and protected. The three commutator segments virtually constitute a single copper ring, mounted in free air, and cut into three equal pieces by slots across its face.\n",

What would he not throw overboard in order to stay ‘on top'—that is, above the others who lack ‘the truth'! The state in which we hurt others is certainly seldom as agreeable, in an unadulterated way, as that in which we benefit others; it is a sign that we are still lacking power, or it betrays a frustration in the face of this poverty; it brings new dangers and uncertainties to the power we do possess and clouds our horizon with the prospect of revenge, scorn, punishment, failure. Only to the most irritable and covetous adherents of the feeling of power—to those for whom the sight of those who are already subjected (the objects of benevolence) is a burden and boredom—might it be more pleasurable to imprint the seal of power on the reluctant. It depends on how one is accustomed to spice one's life; it is a matter of taste whether one prefers the slow or the sudden, the safe or the dangerous and daring increase in power—one always this or that spice according to one's temperament.\n",

(And what was there he did not say at such times!) But what almost always happened after these tearful outbreaks was that next day he was ready to crucify himself for his ingratitude.\n",

When Wagner was born, much of the music that was being written had to follow certain patterns or models just as architects follow certain patterns in building a house.

It was Wagner who did much to set music free from the old barriers. This does not mean that music today is better than music that was written by Haydn and Beethoven.

Under Richelieu the strength of the monarchy had been enhanced and the power of the nobility broken. When he began his personal rule, Louis XIV continued his work of consolidation and in the years of his long reign managed to centralize in the throne every vestige of political power.

There were councils of different sorts and with varied jurisdictions, but men sat in them at the King's behest and were removable at his will.

      "When the ceremonies of the coronation were over, little Isabella's life became a quiet routine of study; for, although a reigning sovereign, she was in the position of that young Duchess of Burgundy of later years, who at the time of her marriage could neither read nor write. This duchess, who married a grandson of Louis XIV of France, was older than Queen Isabella—thirteen years old; and as soon as the wedding festivities were over, she was sent to school in a convent, to learn at least to read, as she knew absolutely nothing save how to dance. Queen Isabella, however, was not sent away to school, but was placed under the care of a very accomplished lady, a cousin of the king, who acted as her governess. In her leisure hours, the king, who was a fine musician, would play and sing for her, and, history gravely informs us, he would even play dolls with her by the hour!\n",

The eggs hatch a day or so later and, being cold-blooded, develop at a rate that is largely controlled by water temperature. Like all crustaceans, Calanus has a rigid external skeleton (exoskeleton) that it must shed in order to grow and develop. In total, there are 12 development stages to their life cycle.

      "At the same time, moths also do things which help people. For example, moths help flowers grow by pollinating them. The downside of this is that the moths also lay their eggs in the leaves of the plant. When the eggs hatch into caterpillars, the munching of the plant begins!

He had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley's grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge;...\n",

So this latter obeys with absolute docility the motions of the operator's hands, as those who were present at the lecture were enabled to see. I will incidentally add that this power hammer was placed on a circuit derived from one that served likewise to supply three Hefner...\n",

This would affect the application of all formulas into which it entered.

There were 565 sets of vertical velocity measurements combined into forty-six series. The forty-six average curves were all very flat a...\n",

All the female trees in Europe are believed to have originated from a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured grafts, and distributed them throughout the Continent. Nevertheless, the female tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male; but it is quite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only may sometimes bear female flowers only.

Although Grandma had many grandchildren, I secretly knew that I was her favorite. She invited me often to her house. She also told me little secrets. But there was one secret she did not share with me. Where she ripened bananas. \\nOne day I saw a big straw basket placed in the sun outside Grandma's house.

Sam starts to cry. \"We will wait a bit longer,\" says his mother. Suddenly, they hear a noise. The bus is coming! The bus arrives at the stop at 10 o'clock. \"Get in!

One afternoon on their way home, Emeka's father stopped to buy something at a big shop. From the car, Emeka looked across the road and saw an old man. He was carrying a big load on his head. He was tired and walked slowly. Emeka kept looking at him. The old man sat under the shade of a tree on the walkway and opened his bag.
